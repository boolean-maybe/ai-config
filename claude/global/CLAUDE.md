# MANDATORY: Skill Check First

Before taking ANY action on ANY user request:
1. Read available_skills from the Skill tool description
2. Does a skill exist that matches this request?
    - YES → Use that skill immediately and stop
    - NO → Proceed with standard approaches

This check is a hard gate. All other actions are blocked until this completes.
